üì¶ **Stackr Hackerpack** is a collection of tools and libraries to help you build decentralized applications on the Stackr ecosystem. It includes a basic Counter micro-rollup and a companion Next.js frontend to help you get started with your project.

üõ†Ô∏è Built using Stackr's SDK, NextJS, Privy, Wagmi and Viem.

- üí≠ **Opinionated APIs**: The included micro-rollup has a server exposed with some opinionated endpoints to get started easily.
- ü™ù **Frontend hooks**: Hooks that makes it breezy to submit actions to Micro-rollup.
- üîê **Embedded Wallet**: We have pre-configured Privy in this example, that can be easily extended to support in-browser wallets as wells as Embedded wallets linked to other identity providers.

## Requirements

Below are the requirements to get started with the pack:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - we leverage Bun's bundler to build our micro-rollups.
- [Node (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Get Started

To quickly get started, you can clone this repository and follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stackrlabs/hackerpack.git
# OR if you want to clone particular branch, use command like below
git clone -b <branch> git@github.com:stackrlabs/hackerpack.git
```

2. Initialize the project by running the setup script

```bash
cd hackerpack
./setup.sh
```

3. Run the project with `mprocs`

```bash
bun dev
```

This sets up the micro-rollup and the web app to run concurrently. You can now visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the web app in action and interact with the rollup by sending actions.

By default
Rollup runs on port `3210`
Web App runs on port `3000`

> [!CAUTION]
> The project comes initialized with a default private key and Privy appId. It is strongly recommended to replace these with your own values in `counter/.env` and `web/.env` files respectively before deploying your application.

## Wallet Setups ‚öôÔ∏è

This repo has been setup with [Privy](https://www.privy.io/), and we have included three modes of wallet setups:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Mode</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Branch</th>
      <th>Deployment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Embedded Wallet with Custodial wallet Auth</td>
      <td>Uses Privy's embedded wallet to sign transactions (signing pop-up can be suppressed)</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/stackrlabs/hackerpack/" target="_blank">main</a></td>
      <td><a href="https://main.hackerpack.stf.xyz" target="_blank">Try it</a></td>
    </tr>
